# Project Name: Library Management System

## Purpose:
    The library management website is built to provide a platform for users to manage their books and resources. It allows users to easily borrow, return, and track library items. Library staff can quickly access information about resources and efficiently manage all operations.

## Actors:
    - We have three main actors in our system:

        1. Librarian: Mainly responsible for adding and modifying books, book items, and users.

        2. User: All users can search the catalog, as well as check-out, renew, and return a book.

        3. Admin: Resposible for managing the whole library.
        
## Scope: 
    1. Manage library catalog: Add, edit, and delete resources.
    2. User accounts: user registration, login, and profile management.
    3. Circulation: Borrowing, returning, renewing of materials.
    4. Search functionality: Find resources by title, author, category, etc.

## Workflow:
    1. User logs in to the website using their credentials.
    2. User searches for a specific item using the search functionality.
    3. If the item is available, the user can proceed to borrow it.
    4. The user checks out the item, and the system updates the inventory accordingly.
    5. When the user is done with the item, they return it using the check-in functionality.
    6. The system marks the item as returned and updates the availability status.
